## Learn Rancher

Managing a Kubernetes cluster can be a challenge, and managing a bunch of them can be, well, like tides of challenges. That’s where Rancher comes in — Rancher is a free, open-source tool that allows you to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, even in different clouds (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE) and data centers. Rancher makes it easier to keep all your clusters up to date and secured so you and your teams can focus on developing cool new apps and features.

You are here to learn over what Rancher is, how it works, how to set it up, and how to navigate around Rancher.
